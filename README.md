# Data_Structures_Wiki_Revision_1
This app is an iteration of my previous app 'Data-Structures-Wiki' https://github.com/FrancisSullivan/Data-Structures-Wiki/

Major changes made for this revision include:
- Data is now stored in an object list, instead of a two-dimesional array.
- The 'Category' input changed from a 'TextBox' to a 'ComboBox', allowing for selection via a drop-down    menu.
- The 'Structure' input changed from a 'TextBox' to a 'GroupBox' containing two 'RadioButtons', only one of each can be selected at a time.
